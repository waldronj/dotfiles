dotfiles
========

These are my dot files. I'm putting them out in the wild to help setup new machines / import my configurations quickly and efficiently.


Instructions
============
1.) Clone repository to local machine
2.) Run the setup.sh, it will change directories into .vim/bundle, then it will clone the vundle repository
3.) Open vim and run :BundleInstall
